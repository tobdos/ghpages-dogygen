# ghpages-testing
repo for testing a doxygen action with the github pages feature.  
Each time a file in /src/* is changed with a push, the html doxygen output is removed & recreated.  
Afterwards a new gh-page is build  
[**Link to the hosted gh-pages site**](https://tobdos.github.io/ghpages-doxygen/)<br>


The action used is taken from [https://github.com/mattnotmitt/doxygen-action](https://github.com/mattnotmitt/doxygen-action)
